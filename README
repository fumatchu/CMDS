(C)atalyst to (M)eraki (D)eployment (S)erver - CMDS (pronounced "commands")

This is a server platform that is designed to provide a seamless experience for migrating 
Catalyst 9300 series switches to the Meraki platform with a Dialog based menu system. 
This can also be leveraged to deploy IOS-XE image updates to any switch needing requirements for catalyst monitoring

The server is built upon Rocky Linux and is script based. It makes this a portable solution across 
any hypervisor that will support Rocky linux, on multiple architectures. 


The Server can be configured with the following capabilities:
  (If in a Lab setting or for testing)
  -An (Optional) NTP server to service the switches
  -An (Optional) DHCP Server to service the switches
  -An (Optional) Caching name server to service the switches
  -A TFTP server for switch config collection (mandatory)
   
  -A Set of scripts to allow you to do the following:
    -Harvest the switches (for analysis)
    -Clean the File System on the switch (remove inactive files)
    -Validate the Version of IOS-XE running on the switch platform (16.6.2 upgrade path to 16.12, oneshot to 17.09.03m3)
    -Provide guidance on the version (s) needed to get to a supported version of IOS-XE for Meraki migration (minimum requirements and oneshot versions)
    -Deploy these (IOS-XE) changes for you
    -Deploy the upgrades on the switches
    -Validate software configurations on the switches
    -If there are any deltas in the configurations, provide guidance to put them into compliance
    -The server will then deploy these changes for you (If needed)
    -Validate hardware configurations on the switches and provide guidance for a successful upgrade
    -Deploy the switches to be registered with the Meraki Cloud
    -Provide API integration to claim the devices to the dashboard
    -Migrate hostnames
    -Provide Switch template configurations for the new deployment (assigning designated ports for wireless, cameras, etc) and deploy via API
    -All of this being able to be scheduled (i.e. IOS-XE images can start at 1 A.M. without any intervention, short of you requesting it, with active and archive logging capabilities)
    -Provide all logging/transaction history 
    -Configuration archival and download
    -Provide documentation of all logging and successful registration with converted Serial Numbers

Installing- 
The requirements for installing are the following:
  -A minimal install of Rocky Linux with at leats 2 GB of RAM and 10 GB of Disk Space, with root access enabled

After the minimal installation of Rocky, in the repository, Click on the EASY_INSTALL file
Inside of this file, you will see the folloing lines of Code:


cd /root/
dnf -y install wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fumatchu/MerakiMigration_c9300/main/mig-installer.sh
chmod 700 ./mig-installer.sh
/root/mig-installer.sh

You can copy it (or from here) and paste into your terminal connection to the server via SSH to start the depndency installs
